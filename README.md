**_Python Homework_** 



Homework consists of 4 parts : **PyBank , PyPoll, PyBoss and PyParagraph** and mainly focusing on basic concepts:
 We practiced **_creating loop, open file to  read/wriet, operating with data structures ( variables, string ,tuple, list, dictionary etc )_**. Special attention was given to **_string comprehension_** applications.
Code was created using **Jupiter Notebook 6.0.3 /Python 3.8.3**

### Part 1. PyBank

Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. Provided data set contains 2 columns of financial data: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

[Main.Py ](/PyBank/main.py) 
 is a python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

and outputs it to [text file](/PyBank/Resources/budget_data_results.txt) 


### Part 2. PyPoll

In this challenge, we are tasked with helping a small, rural town to modernize its vote counting process. 

Poll dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.

[Main.Py ](/PyPoll/main.py)
 is a python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

and outputs it to [text file](/PyBank/Resources/polls_results.txt)
